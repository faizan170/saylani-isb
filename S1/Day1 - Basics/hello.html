    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is <u>simply dummy text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry. <br />



        <i><b>Lorem Ipsum</b></i> has been the <strong>industry's</strong> <em>standard</em> dummy<br /> text ever since
        the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
        book.<br /><br /><br /> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <i>Aldus PageMaker</i> including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.
